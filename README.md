> ## What is Redux !
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, and a very valuable tool for organizing application state. It’s a popular library to manage state in React apps, but it can be used just as well with Angular, Vue.js or just plain old vanilla JavaScript.

> # Here is the main steps required in ReduxJs:

<h2>What is Action?</h2>

>> An action is just an object that always contains the type of logic that is going to be executed on the state (a string that we can name it as we want, but the convention asks it to be upper case and snack case) and the payload or data that is coming from the action.

```sh
    const action = {type: "SET_USER_FIRST_NAME", payload: "Alex"}
```
<h2>What is Reducer?</h2>

>> A reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action as arguments and returns a new state.

```sh
function myReducer(previousState, action) => {
  switch(action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
        return state = state + 1;
        case 'DECREMENT':
        return state = state - 1;
        default:
        return state;
    }
}
```

<h2>What is Store?</h2>

>> In Redux, the store refers to the object that brings actions (that represent what happened) and reducers (that update the state according to those actions) together. There is only a single store in a Redux application.

```sh
        import { createStore } from 'redux';
        import todoReducer from './reducers';

        const store = createStore(todoReducer);
```

<h2>What is Provider?</h2>

>> To give React access the store you need to pass the store into the app. To do this you firstly need to import { Provider } from 'react-redux'. Then you wrap your app in the Provider.

```sh
        const store = createStore(counter);
        render(
            <Provider store={store}>
            <App />
            </Provider>,
            document.getElementById(‘root’)
        );
```


<h2>How to Access Redux State?</h2>

>> Way 1 : Next to access the redux state in a component you need to write a function called mapStateToProps . This function should return an object that you can then reference in your component through it’s props.

There is still one thing to do. You need to use react-redux’s connect method to connect our react and the redux store.

```sh
            import React from 'react'
            import { connect } from "react-redux";
            const App = (props) => {
            return <p>props.count</p>;
            
            };
            function mapStateToProps(state) {
            return {
                count: state
            }
            
            }
            export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App);
```

>> Way 2 : useSelector () Hook | Let’s start by importing useSelector from the react-redux library. useSelector is a function that takes the current state as an argument and returns whatever data you want from it.

```sh
            import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
            const userData = useSelector(state=>state.isSignIn)
```

<h2>How to Update/Change Redux State?</h2>

>> Way 1 : To fire actions we need to make another function called mapDispatchToProps . This will allow us to fire actions from our components and update the state.

There is still one thing to do. You need to use react-redux’s connect method to connect our react and the redux store.

```sh
            import React from 'react'
            import { connect } from "react-redux";
            const App = (props) => {
                <button onClick={props.increment}>+</button>
                <button  onClick={props.decrement}>-</button>
            }

            function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
                return {
                increment: () => dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'}),
                decrement: () => dispatch({type: 'DECREMENT'})
                };
            
            }
            export default connect(null, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
```

>> Way 2 : useDispatchI() Hook | Now let’s try to dispatch an action to the store by importing useDispatch and implementing it to the scope of the functional component.

```sh
            import React from 'react'
            import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
           
        const DempPage= () => {
            const name = useSelector(state=>state.name)
            const dispatch = useDispatch()

            return (
                <>
                    <h1>{name}</h1>
                    <button onClick={dispatch({type:"UPDATE_NAME", payload: "Nuhidul Islam"})}>
                </>
            )
        }
            
 


```
